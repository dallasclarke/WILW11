# What I learned Week-11.

- **filter()** is a method that creates a new array with elements that go through a test implemented by function. If no elements pass an empty array will be returned.
- **map()** This method makes a new array made with the results of calling a function on every element.

**When Not to Use Map()**
1. If you're not going to use the array it returns.
2. Not returning a value from the callback.

**forEach** Will execute a provided function for every array element.

**JS Methods** Methods are properties that contain a function and perform actions on objects. You can access an object method like so:

*objectName.methodName();*
